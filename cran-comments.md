## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE which is me changing my email address as I'm moving jobs. 

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of Bchron (ArchaeoChron, deltar, Bclim) and all installed fine. 

Many thanks for your continuing important work with R,

Andrew
