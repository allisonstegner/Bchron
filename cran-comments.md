## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.2
* rhub
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run install.packages on the 4 downstream dependencies of Bchron (ArchaeoChron, deltar, Bclim, c14bazAAR) and all installed fine. 

Many thanks for your continuing important work with R,

Andrew
